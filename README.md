=============

Roguelike game with zombies!!

Roguelike game made for the 7 Day Roguelike Challenge. You can download a compiled copy of the game there if you search for my name (Theo HÃ¶gberg) in the roguelike section. It was made using a swing JTextArea instead of the standard C based roguelike you usually have. 

Everything was made from sratch, nothing has been borrowed from other projects except the pretty welcome screen (which isn't used anyway).
